      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>It's zucchini season! Bring on the zucchini recipes!</p>
      <p>Partway through July every summer, I start to feel like I've cooked all the zucchini recipes out there. I've
        made zucchini bread and zucchini fritters, grilled zucchini and baked zucchini chips. This week, I looked at my
        market haul of summer squash and asked, “What next?”. If you're in a similar spot right now, I have good news:
        zucchini is one versatile veggie. It tastes fantastic in pastas, tacos, salads, and even chocolate cake! You can
        grill it, bake it, sauté it, and also eat it raw. We might feel like we've cooked it in every way known to man,
        but there are always more zucchini recipes to try.</p>
      <p>Below, you'll find one of the best and eaiest zucchini recipes that I turn to every summer. They include hearty
        main courses, fresh salads, decadent desserts, and everything in between. I hope they inspire you to try cooking
        zucchini in a new way. And if you have any favorite zucchini recipes to recommend, let me know in the comments!

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <p>Here's what you need: 500g / 1 lb (or so) zucchini, 2 tablespoons each breadcrumbs and parmesan (store
        bought!), oil, salt and pepper. Just a bit of parmesan adds terrific savoury flavour and a touch of breadcrumbs
        adds welcome texture. The two little things that makes this quick recipe so good!</p>

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <p>Now the fun part - showing you how this is so quick and easy. Lining them up together on the tray is my trick
        for capturing 99% of the parmesan and breadcrumbs without the hassle of dredging / coating!</p>
      <ol class="text-list">
        <li>Cut in quarters or sixths lengthwise - minimal chopping!</li>
        <li>Toss with oil, salt & pepper, line them up next to each other, then sprinkle the breadcrumbs and parmesan
          straight on top. Because they're touching, it “catches” most of the parmesan and breadcrumbs.</li>
        <li>Drizzle with oil - just 2 teaspoons or so - then bake 12 minutes in a super hot oven...</li>
        <li>Until the parmesan becomes golden and the zucchini is tender but not mushy. Voila! Speedy Baked Zucchini!
